## Variable Definitions Guide

The two clean datasets containing criminal data are clean_criminal_cases.dta and clean_nibrs_cases.dta

### clean_criminal_cases.dta

The following variables are cleaned separately for each city.

#### Crime type

`crime_type == Sexual assault` if the crime includes physical contact.

- Rape
- Sodomy
- Sexual assault

`crime_type == Sexual harrassment` if the crime does not include physical contact.

- Stalking
- Indecent exposure
- Window peeping
- Public lewdness

`crime_type == Excluded crime` if the crime is not directly affected by the MeToo movement but could be indirectly related to it.

- Bestiality
- Bigamy
- Sex crimes against children
- Domestic/dating violence
- Harrassment of unclear nature
- Incest
- Pornography
- Prostitution
- Registration of sexual offenders

`crime_type == Non-sex crime` for all other crimes.

#### Sexual harassment

`sh == 1` if `crime_type` is Sexual harassment.  
`sh == 0` otherwise

#### Sex-based cases

`sex_cases == 1` if `crime_type` is Sexual harassment or Sexual assault.  
`sex_cases == 0` otherwise.

#### Clearance

`clearance == 1` if the case was cleared by arrest or exception  
`clearance == 0` if the case was not cleared

#### Victim female

`victim_f = 1` if complainant/victim is female  
`victim_f = 0` if complainant/victim is male  
`victim_f = .` if missing data on complainant gender

The following variables are cleaned altogether, after city data is appended together.

#### Overlap

`overlap == 1` if `sex_cases == 1` and case filed before MeToo and resolved after MeToo  
`overlap == 0` if `sex_cases == 1` and case filed before MeToo and resolved before MeToo  
`overlap == .` if `sex_cases == 0`  
`overlap == .` if case filed after MeToo

#### Treat

`post = 1` if file date after MeToo.  
`post = 0` if file date before MeToo.  
`post = .` never

`treat = post*sex_cases`  
`treat = 1` if `overlap == 1` since overlap cases are sex cases AND treated, but definition of post doesn't capture them.

### clean_nibrs_cases.dta

#### Crime type

`crime_type == Sexual assault` if `crime_code` is 111, 112, 113, 114, or 362, leading to:

- Aggravated assault where the victim was:

`crime_type == Non-sex crime` for all other crimes.

#### Sex-based cases

`sex_cases == 1` if `crime_type == Sexual assault`
`sex_cases == 0` if `crime_type ==  Non-sex crime`
`sex_cases == .` if `crime_type ==  Excluded crime`

#### Sexual harassment cases

`sh == .` always, since no sexual harassment cases are reported to NIBRS

#### Clearance

`clearance == 1` if the case was marked as cleared by arrest or cleared by prosecution deciding not to prosecute
`clearance == 0` if the case is not marked as resulting in arrest or exceptional clearance - per FBI this means that the case is marked as not cleared
`clearance == .` if the case was cleared exceptionally for any other reason

#### Victim_f

`victim_f == 1` if any victim of the case is female
`victim_f == 0` if all victims are male
`victim_f == .` if no data is available

#### Court

`court == 1` if the case went to court
`court == 0` otherwise

#### Overlap

`overlap == 1` if `sex_cases == 1` and case filed before MeToo and resolved after MeToo
`overlap == 0` if `sex_cases == 1` and case filed before MeToo and resolved before MeToo
`overlap == .` if `sex_cases == 0`

`post = 0` if file date before MeToo.  
`post = .` never
