## Variable Definitions Guide

The following variables are cleaned separately for each city.

### Crime type
`crime_type == Sexual assault` if the crime includes physical contact.  
- Rape
- Sodomy
- Sexual assault

`crime_type == Sexual harrassment` if the crime does not include physical contact.
- Stalking
- Indecent exposure
- Window peeping
- Public lewdness

`crime_type == Excluded crime` if the crime is not directly affected by the MeToo movement but could be indirectly related to it.
- Bestiality
- Bigamy
- Sex crimes against children
- Domestic/dating violence
- Harrassment of unclear nature
- Incest
- Pornography
- Prostitution
- Registration of sexual offenders

`crime_type == Non-sex crime` for all other crimes.

### Sexual harassment
`sh == 1` if `crime_type` is Sexual harassment.  
`sh == 0` otherwise  

### Sex-based cases
`sex_cases == 1` if `crime_type` is Sexual harassment or Sexual assault.  
`sex_cases == 0` otherwise.  

### Clearance
`clearance == 1` if the case was cleared by arrest or exception  
`clearance == 0` if the case was not cleared  

The following variables are cleaned altogether, after city data is appended together. 

### Overlap
`overlap == 1` if `sh == 1` and case filed before MeToo and resolved after MeToo  
`overlap == 0` if `sh == 1` and case filed before MeToo and resolved before MeToo  
`overlap == .` if `sh == 0`  
`overlap == .` if case filed after MeToo  

### Treat
`post = 1` if file date after MeToo.   
`post = 0` if file date before MeToo.    
`post = .` never  

`treat = post*sh`  
`treat = .` if `sex_cases == 1 & sh == 0`, since we don't want the control group to include potentially treated sex cases that are not sexual harassment.  
`treat = 1` if `overlap == 1` since overlap cases are sh AND treated, but definition of post doesn't capture them.
